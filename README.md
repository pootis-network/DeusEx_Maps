Game maps for the [Deus EX (2000)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/) game.

# Dependencies
Some of these maps may depend on the following:
* Zombies mod by Artie (for Zombie maps)
* GreenCTF (for CTF maps, not sure if compatible with MTL)
* MTL (ultra-obfuscated anticheat and improvement mod for Deus Ex)
* CDX (improvement to MTL and game balancing, i personally dont like it that much)
* FunLine [FL]'s Keypad (Secure Multiplayer Keypads)
* Map-specific mods/textures/misc (Included in /dependencies of map folder)
